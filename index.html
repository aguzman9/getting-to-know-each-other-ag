        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Adrian Guzman and I am 19 years old. 
        I currently live in Joliet Illinois. My major is Physics with a concentration in Mechanical engineering and I have no minor.</p>
        <p>I have my 2 parents and 2 older siblings. My sister actually graduated from Lewis and thats why I decided to come here.</p>
        <p>I also have a dog, I am not 100% sure of his breed but he is some sort of poodle mix.</p>
        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some coding like this so I could just have fun with it</li>
            <li>Try to create a little game like tic-tac-toe</li>
            <li>Make a program that can calculate some things for me</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
        <p>For a while now I have been interested in space and the ocean, so learning about that stuff is pretty cool.</p>
        <p>I have joined the Astronomy club and we have only met once so far, but hopefully we meet more so I can see more planets.</p>
        <p>I also play video games, right now the game I have the most time on is Rocket League.</p>
        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I played soccer when I was young, but quit to do Mexican folkloric dance. I regret it</p>
